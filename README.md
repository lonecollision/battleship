# Battleship

## About The Game
Hello and welcome to Battleship!
On a 10 x 10 board, 5 ships are randomly generated horizontally/vertically.

You play by guessing where the following types of ships are on the board:
* Aircraft carrier (5 units long)
* Battleship (4 units long)
* Submarine (3 units long)
* Destroyer (3 units long)
* Patrol Boat (2 units long)

You have 4 radars that detect ships within a 1 unit radius.

You are also equipped with 50 missiles, if you are unable to destroy all ships
with these missiles you will lose, so use them wisely!

Scoring anything under -20 will result in game over.

## Technologies
The game was made with Java and and tested with JUnit.
